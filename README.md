# Study Focus Timer — Day 3 ⏱️

Day 3 

This project is a **CLI-based study timer** built to practice structured logic using
**dictionaries, loops, and time-based execution**.  
Unlike earlier days, this tool is **actually usable** for real study sessions.

---

##  What this app does
- Lets the user choose a study mode:
  - `short` (25 minutes)
  - `long` (50 minutes)
  - `break` (10 minutes)
- Starts a live countdown timer
- Updates time every second
- Can be stopped anytime using **Ctrl + C**

---

##  Concepts practiced
- Dictionaries (`dict`)
- While loops
- Time-based programs using `time.sleep`
- Input validation
- Graceful program interruption (`KeyboardInterrupt`)
- Writing stable, long-running CLI programs

---

##  How to run
```bash
python study_timer.py
